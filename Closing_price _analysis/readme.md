Closing Price Trend Analysis using LSTM
This project aims to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to analyze the trend of closing prices for a given stock. The goal is to predict whether the closing price for a future date will increase or decrease based on the past closing price data.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Keras
Data
The data used in this project is the daily closing price of a stock over a certain period of time. This data can be obtained from a financial website or by using a web scraping tool.

Preprocessing
Before training the LSTM model, the data needs to be preprocessed. This includes splitting the data into training and test sets, normalizing the data, and creating a time series dataset.

Training
The LSTM model is trained using the training data. The model will learn to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions about the future closing price based on these patterns.

Evaluation
After training the model, it is evaluated on the test data to see how well it performs at predicting the trend of the closing price. The model's accuracy is calculated and plotted to visualize the results.

Usage
To use this model, you can call the predict() function and pass in a list of past closing prices. The function will return a prediction for the next closing price.

Further Work
There are many ways to improve this model and make it more accurate. Some ideas include using more data, fine-tuning the model hyperparameters, and incorporating additional features such as volume or moving averages.
